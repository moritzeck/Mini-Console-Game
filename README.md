# Mini-Console-Game
This was my very first little Java project during an online course I did some months ago. 
I just learned about the topic "arrays" and this really little console game was kind of my homework to do.
At this time, it was more difficult of course. The game isn't anything special, but I still thought why not upload it.
In the game you can simply move a "figure" within a playing field.
